This executable was built upon subGlitch's answer in the following issue: [Nvidia graphics driver causing noticeable frame stuttering](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36959508/nvidia-graphics-driver-causing-noticeable-frame-stuttering)

Nuri Yuri just made an exe out of that for the purpose of its own projects.
